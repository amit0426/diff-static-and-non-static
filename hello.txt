//What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it with an example?

static => 1. All static member will be loaded in to ram first. 
2. static method is a method that belongs to a class;
3. this method calls without the instance or object of that class;
4. Static method can only acces static data members and static methods of another 
class or same class;
5. the memory of a static method is fixed in the ram, for this reason ;

class Jay {

public static int sum(int a, int b)
{

return a+b;
}

}


class Hello {

public static void main(String[] args){

int n =3, m=6;
int s = Jay.sum(n,m);

System.out.print("sum is = " +s)
}


}



non static =>1. Non-static methods can access any static method and static variable
withot creating an instance of the object;
2.non-static methd can access static data members as well as non-static members and methods of another class or
same also can change the values of any static data member;
3.we don,t need the object of a class in which the static method is defined to call;


class Hello{

public void geet()
{
Hello g = new Hello();
g.geet()

}

}
